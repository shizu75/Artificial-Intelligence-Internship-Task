# Artificial Intelligence & BCI Internship – Teresol

## Internship Details
- **Organization:** Teresol  
- **Role:** Artificial Intelligence Intern  
- **Duration:** 9 July 2024 – 20 August 2024  
- **Supervisor:** Javeria Ehsan  

This repository documents the **technical work, learning tasks, and practical implementations** completed during my AI internship at Teresol. The internship emphasized **conceptual clarity, implementation from scratch, and exposure to Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems**, rather than relying on pre-built solutions.

---

## Internship Focus
The internship was structured to build a **strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence**, with progressive exposure to:
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Model implementation from scratch
- Deep Learning Fundamentals
- Evaluation Metrics
- Object detection and Image Processing
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Introduction to Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems
- Biomedical and neural signal processing concepts

The work followed a **task-based learning approach**, combining theory, implementation, and validation.

### 3. Machine Learning Models (From Scratch)
Implemented and analyzed machine learning models **without relying solely on high-level abstractions**, focusing on internal mechanics such as:
- Model initialization
- Forward computation
- Loss calculation
- Gradient-based optimization
- Performance evaluation

This approach helped develop a clear understanding of **how models learn**, rather than treating them as black boxes.

---

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation
- Training-validation split strategies
- Understanding overfitting and underfitting
- Performance metrics and evaluation techniques
- Iterative model improvement based on results

Emphasis was placed on **reasoning behind model behavior**, not just numerical accuracy.
